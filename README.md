# Transmission
## A nice and simple messaging/mail plugin.

### Feature Set
Transmission is a plugin that makes inter-player messaging and mail simple. Messages are formatted neatly and mails are stored in an SQL database that utilises read/unread statuses. Transmission also offers two separate capacities for server staff to talk in an 'official' manner. One on behalf of themselves, the other on behalf of the server.
